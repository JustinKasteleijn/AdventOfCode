This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges implemented in C++. Advent of Code is an annual
programming event where a new coding puzzle is released each day in December leading up to Christmas.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is an online coding event that offers a series of daily programming puzzles. These puzzles are designed
to be fun and challenging, covering various topics and concepts in computer science and programming. Each puzzle
typically has two parts, with the second part building upon the first.

The solution code is written to solve the specific challenge for that day. However, feel free to modify and adapt the
code as needed.

Please note that these solutions are my personal attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges. They may not be the
most optimized or efficient solutions, but they are intended to showcase my problem-solving approach and coding style.

Feel free to explore the solutions, provide feedback, and share your own solutions if you find alternative approaches or
improvements.
